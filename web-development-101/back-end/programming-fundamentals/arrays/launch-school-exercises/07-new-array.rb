# Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array 
# that is the result of incrementing each value in the original array 
# by a value of 2. You should have two arrays at the end of this program, 
# The original array and the new array you've created. Print both arrays 
# to the screen using the p method instead of puts.

# arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]
# new_array = []

# arr.map do |index|
#   new_array << index + 2
# end

# arr.each do |n|
#   new_array << n + 2
# end

# p arr
# p new_array
