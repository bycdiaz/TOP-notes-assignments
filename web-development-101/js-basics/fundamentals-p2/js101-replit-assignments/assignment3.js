Let's do some math.
(let's make the computer do some math for us)

for each of the variables in the code supply the requested formula

a = one plus eight!
b = 22 times three!
c = the remainder of 5 / 4
d = the variable a minus 17
e = the sum of the previous 4 variables

const e = a + b + c + d ;

console.log({a, b, c, d, e})
