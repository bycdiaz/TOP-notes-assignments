/*
switch statements are your friend here â€” they take a single expression/value as
an input, and then look through a number of choices until they find one that
matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it.
Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea:

switch (expression) {
  case choice1:
    run this code
    break;

  case choice2:
    run this code instead
    break;

  // include as many cases as you like

  default:
    actually, just run this code
}
