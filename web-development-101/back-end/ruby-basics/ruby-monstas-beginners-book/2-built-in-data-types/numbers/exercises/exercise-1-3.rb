# Methods are a way of “doing something with an object”. E.g. in Ruby, 
# numbers have two methods that allow you to check whether the number 
# is odd or even.

# Look through the documentation for integer numbers (called Fixnum) 
# and find the methods that tell if a number is odd or even.

even = 2

odd = 3
